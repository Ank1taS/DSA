Maximum Square Matrix With All Zeros


Given an NxM matrix that contains only 0s and 1s, find out the size of the maximum square sub-matrix with all 0s. You need to return the size of the square matrix with all 0s.
Input format :
The first line of the test case contains two integer values, 'N' and 'M', separated by a single space. They represent the 'rows' and 'columns' respectively.

Second-line onwards, the next 'N' lines or rows represent the ith row values.

Each of the ith rows constitutes column values separated by a single space (Either 0 or 1).
Output Format:
Print the size of maximum square sub-matrix.
 Constraints :
0 <= N <= 10^4
0 <= M <= 10^4
